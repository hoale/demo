                        <p>
                            <strong>What exactly do you do?</strong></br>
                            We deliver good office coffee and lease amazing coffee equipment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Do you charge for delivery?</strong></br>
                            FDelivery is free for all orders of 10lbs or more.  And don't worry, there are no sneaky fuel surcharges either.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>How often do you deliver?</strong></br>
                            To ensure freshness, our coffee is roasted to order and delivered on a bi-weekly basis .  Why so often?  Because we don't want you drinking old coffee, which tastes, well, old.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Is there a contract?</strong></br>
                            None whatsoever.  Nor should there be!  It's always been our opinion that contracts have no place in a service business.  The quality of our office coffee service alone should be the reason you keep coming back.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            <strong>How does ordering work?</strong></br>
                            Since all of our coffee is roasted to order, orders should be placed the week before you want a delivery.  Orders can be placed by phone (917.670.3314), email (orders@joyridecoffee.com), from our website, or on a recurring basis.  Stumptown, Blue Bottle, Intelligentsia, Joe and Toby's Estate come in 1 and 5lb bags.  We can only offer Counter Culture in 5lb bags and it cannot be pre ground.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>How many types of coffee can I order?</strong></br>As many as you'd like! That said, most of our customers prefer to split their order between something they always get and something new that alternates with each delivery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Can I make a recurring order?</strong></br>
                            Yes. Many of our customers have recurring orders, which can always be tweaked, of course. In fact, most of our customers prefer to let us keep track of your office's usage and future ordering needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Can I get my coffee ground?</strong></br>
                            Absolutely. We grind your beans for you, according to the specifications of your brewer, immediately before delivery to guarantee freshness. We can, of course, also deliver your coffee whole bean, if you prefer to do your own grinding. Counter Culture coffees are not available ground.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>How does payment work?</strong></br>
                            We'll invoice you for each order, which you can pay by check or credit card. If we have your card on file, we run it only after delivery has been made.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>How do I become a customer?</strong></br>
                            We're glad you asked! All you need to do is contact us.  In under five minutes we'll have you all set up to receive your first order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Do you offer tea?</strong></br>
                            Coming soon!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Do you offer coffee pods, k-cups, etc?</strong></br>
                            In a word, no.  It's our belief that single-serve systems make poor quality coffee and we know they're a poor value, sporting effective prices per pound in excess of $25!  Simply put, we don't sell pods, because our locally and freshly roasted coffee not only tastes much better, but is also less expensive to boot. Simply put, they don't make very good office coffee.
